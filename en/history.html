			<h2>
			1. The premises of universal suffrage in&nbsp;France
			</h2>

			<br>
			
			<h3>1. What is suffrage ?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					A suffrage is an opinion, advice, judgement, statement, or vote
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Suffrage" means the "right to vote".
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>2. Why do we say universal ?</h3>

			
			<ul>
				<li>
					Suffrage is universal as long as it concerns all citizens who have the electoral capacity.
				</li>
				<li>
					So without any distinction of sex, race, origin, religion, etc., the same applies to all the other groups.
				</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
					 	We only take into account :
					</li>
					<li>
						Age: over 18 years old (today)
				</li>
				<li>
					Possession of French nationality
				</li>
				<li>
					Moral capacity
				</li>
				<li>
					The registration of a list of electors
				</li>
				</ul>
				<li>
					Universal suffrage is the first condition for a democratic political life.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>3. Birth of universal suffrage in France:  : implementation&nbsp;steps</h3>
			
			 <ul>
				 <li>
					 <span class="date">1789</span> : he revolution was the trigger, the idea of suffrage emerges.
				 </li>
				 
				 <ul>
					 <li>
						 Citizens demand access to the political system by electing their legitimate representatives.
					 </li>
				 
					 <li>
						 They therefore demand indirect suffrage.
					 </li>
				 </ul>
				 
				 <br>
				 
				<li>
					 <span class="date">1791</span> : During the constitution of 3 September 1791, the right to vote was introduced in the form of a censal suffrage. This right to vote is restricted:
				 </li>
				 <ul>
					 <li>
						 Men aged 25 or under cannot vote
					 </li>
					 
					 <li>
						 Men who do not pay direct taxes cannot vote either.
					 </li>
				</ul>

 				<br>
				 
				 <li>
					 <span class="date">1799</span> : Universal male suffrage but limited
				 </li>
				 
				 <ul>
					 <li>
						 All men over the age of 21 who have been living in the country for at least one year may vote.
					 </li>
					 
					 <li>
						 It is a limited suffrage: The voters designate one tenth of them to appear on the communal lists. The latter in turn elect one tenth of them to appear on the departmental lists, which in turn elect one tenth of them to appear on the national list.
					 </li>
				</ul>

				 <br>
				 
				 <li>
					 <span class="date">1815</span> : Return to censal suffrage
				 </li>
				 
				<ul>
					 <li>
						  After the defeat of Napoleon I on 18 June 1815, a constitutional monarchy was established.
					 </li>
					
					 <li>
						 Universal suffrage thus abolished and censal suffrage restored
					 </li>
					 
					 <li>
						 Thus, only men over 30 years of age and paying a direct contribution of 300 francs can vote.
					 </li>
				</ul>

				 <br>
				
				 <li>
					 <span class="date">1848</span> : Universal male suffrage
				 </li>
				 
				 <ul>
					 <li>
						 February 1848 marked the end of the Monarchy and the birth of the Republic. It is the Parisian revolution from February 22nd to 25th.
					 </li>
					 
					 <li>
						 The decree of 5 March 1848 adopts universal male suffrage: any French man over the age of 21 can vote.
					 </li>
					 
					 <li>
						 Moreover, it is a secret ballot.
					 </li>
				</ul>

				 <br>
				 
				 <li>
					 <span class="date">1944</span> : Universal suffrage
				 </li>
				 
				 <ul>
					 <li>
						 The right to vote is granted to women, making suffrage officially universal.
					 </li>
					 
					 <li>
						  Any citizen who is over 18 years of age and has the capacity to vote may vote.
					 </li>
					 
					 <li>
						 Until today, this system of universal suffrage has been retained and adopted in the various elections (presidential, municipal, etc.).
					 </li>
				</ul>
